# Manifest Version 2 to 3 Converter

Converting your browser extension from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 is a big task. With Itero's MV2-MV3 Converter, you can convert your extension to Manifest V3 with a single click. You can then use the TestBed to test your extension and make sure it works as expected.

Expand your extension on the Itero dashboard and click on MV2 to MV3.

Starter-tier users can only convert their manifest.json file. Pro-tier users can
also have their code scanned!

If you haven't already, click "Run Code Scanning" to scan your code for any issues. This will help you identify any issues that you might have with your extension.

## Manifest Converter

Plasmo will look through your manifest.json file and let you know what you need to change in order to be MV3-ready. You can also click "Download MV3 Manifest" to download a manifest.json file that's ready for MV3.

## Code Scanning

Pro users get the added benefit of having their code scanned. This will identify if your extension uses any MV2-only features that are not supported in MV3.
