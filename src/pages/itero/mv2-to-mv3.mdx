# Manifest Version 2 to 3 Converter

Converting your browser extension from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 is a big task. With Itero's Mv2-Mv3 Converter, you can convert your extension to Manifest V3 with a single click. You can then use the TestBed to test your extension and make sure it works as expected.

You'll see an entire page dedicated to converting your extension.

Starter-tier users can only convert their manifest.json file. Pro-tier users can also have their code scanned!

If you haven't already, click "Run Code Scanning" to scan your code for any issues. This will help you identify any issues that you might have with your extension.

Pro users get the added benefit of having their code scanned. This will identify if your extension uses any MV2-only features that are not supported in MV3.
