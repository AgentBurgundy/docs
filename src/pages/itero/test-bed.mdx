# Itero TestBed

Itero TestBed is a staging environment for browser extensions. Test your browser extensions instantly without dragging and dropping zip files or waiting for browser stores to approve your updates.

## Prerequisites

You must have an account on [Itero](https://itero.plasmo.com). If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](https://itero.plasmo.com).

## Steps

### 1. Prepare your extension's zip bundle

> Note: You can skip this step if you already have a zip file of your extension.

If you're using the Plasmo Framework:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm package
```

For more detail, check out the [documentation](/framework/workflows/build#generating-a-zip-bundle) on the build pipeline.

### 2. Upload your browser extension's zip file on Itero

Take the zip file that you created in the previous step and upload it to Itero. You can do this by going to the [TestBed](https://itero.plasmo.com) page and clicking the "Upload new Extension" button.

### 3. Share your extension's link with your beta testers

Your beta testers will have to install Plasmo's software, and then install your extension with a single click. Updates will automatically be pushed to them as you make changes.

## Github Integration

Itero TestBed can be integrated with GitHub. This allows you to automatically deploy your browser extensions to Itero TestBed when you push to your GitHub repository. Visit the [GitHub Integration](/itero/github) page for more information.
