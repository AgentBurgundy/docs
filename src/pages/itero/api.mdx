# Manual Upload API

If you would like to bring your own builder CI/CD pipeline instead of leveraging the [Itero's GitHub App](/itero/github) integration, this page is for you! By manually submitting your zip file to Itero, your CI pipeline will not be limited by the number of seat licenses you have on Itero to trigger the cloud builder.

This flow is provided as-is. For support regarding integration with your system, we offer a consulting service. Email `support@plasmo.com` for more detail.

## Download the API Key

Go to the settings page of your extension and download the API key. The key is a JSON file with the following shape:

```json
{
  "itero": {}
}
```

## Submission via GitHub Action

You may use the key with the [BPP](/framework/workflows/submit) GitHub Action to automatically upload your extension to Itero. Simply add the `itero` key to your existing BPP's secret or as a separate secret workflow.

Make sure your BPP version is [v3.3.0](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/bpp/releases/tag/v3.3.0) or above.

## Submission via API Calls

First, create a zip file of your extension. Then, follow the flows below:

### 1. POST `https://itero.plasmo.com/api/submit/upload`

This endpoint issues a signed URL for you to upload your extension to.

The request body must contain the `keys.itero` object, e.g:

```ts
const keys = JSON.parse(await readFile("./keys.json", "utf8")) // with keys.json being the file you downloaded from the settings page

...

await fetch("https://itero.plasmo.com/api/submit/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(keys.itero)
})
```

The response is a JSON containing the upload url:

```json
{
  "url": "signed-upload-url"
}
```

### 2. PUT signed-upload-url

Take the response url from step 1 and issue a PUT request to it with the zip blob. Ensure that the `Content-Type` header is `application/zip`

### 3. POST `https://itero.plasmo.com/api/submit/sign`

After uploading is done, you will need to call the sign endpoint to finalize the process and update the extension bundle that will be served to the beta testers.

The request body must contain the `keys.itero` object like step 1.
