### Itero beta testers

- Visit [/itero/testers](/itero/testers) for details on how to install an extension hosted on Itero.

## TestBed

TestBed is the staging environment for browser extension development. Iterate faster without a review process, and test new changes with each and every push.

Testing browser extensions is hard. You either have to wait for draconian review times, or you have to ask your testers to manually install the extension every time you make a change. With Itero TestBed, you can instantly push your browser extension to your beta testers without having to wait for a review or manually install the extension.

For a more in-depth view of TestBed, check out the [Testbed page](./itero/test-bed)

## Builder

Build your extension and automatically push it to TestBed with every push. The Itero Builder pipeline integrates your GitHub workflow with Itero TestBed, thus each push to your repository will automatically be deployed to your beta testers.

To setup Builder:

## Publisher

Itero Publisher enables you to publish your browser extension to the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons Store. You can also use Itero Publisher to publish your extension to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store, but you'll need to have a Microsoft Partner Center account.

## MV2 to MV3 Toolkits

You can use Itero with both MV2 and MV3 extensions. If you're looking to convert your extension from MV2 to MV3, check out the [MV2 to MV3 Converter](./itero/mv2-to-mv3).
