# Getting Started with Itero

Itero is the staging environment for browser extension development. Iterate faster without a review process, and test new changes with each and every push.

## TestBed

Testing browser extensions is hard. You either have to wait for draconian review times, or you have to ask your testers to manually install the extension every time you make a change. With Itero TestBed, you can instantly push your browser extension to your beta testers without having to wait for a review or manually install the extension.

For a more in-depth view of Itero, check out the [Testbed page](./itero/testbed)

## Prerequisites

You must have an account on [Itero](https://itero.plasmo.com). If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](https://itero.plasmo.com).

## Steps

### 1. Prepare your extension's zip bundle

> Note: You can skip this step if you already have a zip file of your extension.

If you're using the Plasmo Framework:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm package
```

For more detail, check out the [documentation](/framework/workflows/build#generating-a-zip-bundle) on the build pipeline.

If you're manually zipping, make sure your `manifest.json` file is at the root of the zip file:

#### macOS & Linux

```bash
cd /path/to/extension
zip -r ../extension.zip *
```

#### Windows

```powershell
cd /path/to/extension
Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath ../extension.zip
```

### 2. Upload your browser extension's zip file on Itero

Take the zip file that you created in the previous step and upload it to Itero. You can do this by going to the [TestBed](https://itero.plasmo.com) page and clicking the "Upload new Extension" button.

### 3. Share your extension's link with your beta testers

Your beta testers will have to install Plasmo's software, and then install your extension with a single click. Updates will automatically be pushed to them as you make changes.
