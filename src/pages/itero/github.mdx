# Itero GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration enables:

- Builder to automatically build and push your extension to Itero TestBed
-

Please note that GitHub integration binding is 1-to-1 between a GitHub "entity" and an Itero "entity". An entity can be a user or an organization. Thus, if you were on a Starter Tier and bound your personal Itero account with your GitHub organization, you will need to remove the integration and re-integrate the Itero Team with your GitHub organization entity.
