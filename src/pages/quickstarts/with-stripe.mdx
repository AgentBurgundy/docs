# Quickstart with Stripe

## Intro

Stripe is a payment processing platform. Use cases include:

- Monetizing access to expensive API calls
- Monetizing premium extension feature
- Selling themes, merchs, physical and digital goods, etc...

## Scenario

You are a SaaS company looking to offer a premium API service to your customer via an extension. You would like your users to pay $5/month before the extension can access this premium feature.

## Setting Up a Stripe Product Link

Due to [Manifest v3's restriction with remote code execution](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/#remotely-hosted-code), there are limited options to have a PCI-compliant payment system integrated into an extension. The easiest way is to setup a Stripe Product Link.

To setup a Stripe Product Link, you will first need to create a Stripe product. Head to [Stripe Product Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true) page, and press Add Product, then fill out the information:

![Stripe add Product](/screenshots/stripe-add-product.png)

Then, go to the product page and click the `Create payment link` button:

![Stripe create payment](/screenshots/stripe-create-payment.png)

Above should get you the the Stripe Payment Link. For backend authorization, head to the [Stripe Dashboard Home Page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard) for the Secret Key:

## Using env variable

Assuming you have setup a basic Plasmo project, the first thing to do is to setup our [environment variables](/workflows/env):

`.env.local`

```ini
PLASMO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/test_XXXXXXXX

STRIPE_PRIVATE_API_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

To enable typescript intellisense, create an `index.d.ts` file:

`.index.d.ts`

```ts
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_LINK?: string

    STRIPE_PRIVATE_API_KEY?: string
  }
}
```

## Accessing Chrome identity API

In order to associate a subscription with an user, we can use their email address. One quick way of doing so is to leverage the Chrome extension's [identity API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/#method-getProfileUserInfo). In production environment, you might want to setup proper authorization with a simple JWT to ensure the user doesn'

To enable the permission required for this feature, add the following to the `manifest` field of your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "manifest": {
    "permissions": ["identity", "identity.email"]
  }
}
```
