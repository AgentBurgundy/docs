## Overriding the Manifest

The Plasmo framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field for you to overide the default extension manifest. Use this to specify permissions and any additional hosts you might need, as well as extra `option_uis` configs.

We also use a `displayName` field in the `package.json` to specify the name of the web extension.
