# Customization

Plasmo is an opinionated framework, but we offer customization for cases where the framework hasn't formed an opinion about a particular topic.

## Overriding the Manifest

The following fields from the `package.json` will be passed over to the generated extension manifest:

- `packageJson.version` -> `manifest.version`
- `packageJson.displayName` -> `manifest.name`
- `packageJson.description` -> `manifest.description`
- `packageJson.author` -> `manifest.author`

The Plasmo Framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field that overrides the generated extension manifest. Use this to make specific changes to the generated manifest, which the Plasmo framework doesn't natively support yet.

For instance, the Plasmo Framework might not understand that you need to have an `activeTab` permission.

You'll need to modify your project's `package.json` like so:

```json
...
"manifest": {
    "permissions": [
        "activeTab"
    ]
}
```

Eventually, the framework will get smarter about adding these kinds of things into the generated `manifest.json`, but for the time being, some manual work is still required.
