## Overriding the Manifest

The following fields from the `package.json` will be passed over to the extension manifest:

- `packageJson.version` -> `manifest.version`
- `packageJson.displayName` -> `manifest.name`
- `packageJson.description` -> `manifest.description`
- `packageJson.author` -> `manifest.author`

The Plasmo framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field for you to overide the generated extension manifest. Use this to specify permissions and any additional hosts you might need, as well as extra `option_uis` configs.

## Using an alternative root directory for source code (e.g, `src`)

Instead of having your source code in the root directory, you can put them in a child directory instead. Simply add the directory name as the resolved `paths` for the `~*` prefix in the `tsconfig.json` file, and the Typescript compiler will know how to resolves your code. The example configuration below reads source code from the `src` sub-directory:

```json
{
  "extends": "plasmo/templates/tsconfig.base",
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": [".plasmo/**/*", "./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "~*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

This allows Plasmo to seamlessly integrate with most NodeJS project. See [with-src](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-src).
