## Overriding the Manifest

The following fields from the `package.json` will be passed over to the extension manifest:

- `packageJson.version` -> `manifest.version`
- `packageJson.displayName` -> `manifest.name`
- `packageJson.description` -> `manifest.description`
- `packageJson.author` -> `manifest.author`

The Plasmo framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field for you to overide the generated extension manifest. Use this to specify permissions and any additional hosts you might need, as well as extra `option_uis` configs.
