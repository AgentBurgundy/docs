# Development cycle

Once your project is setup, you can start developing your extension by first `cd` inside your project, then:

```sh
pnpm dev # OR plasmo dev
```

This will create a dev bundle for your extension, as well as a hot-reloading development server, which will automatically update your extension bundle on file changes. It will also reload your browser on content-script changes. _(Coming soon)_

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build  # OR plasmo dev
```

> **NOTE:** Since plasmo's default typescript configuration treats all source file as a module, if your source is not importing anything, please add a `export {}` at the start of your source. (You will see this warning when you created your first content script!)

## Adding a Popup Page

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file, then start coding away! See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script).

## Adding Content Scripts

Create a `content.ts` file, and start coding away! See [with-content-script](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script).

For multiple content scripts, create a `contents` directory, and add your content scripts there. See [with-many-content-scripts](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-many-content-scripts).

To provide custom content script configuration (such as matching custom domain per script, all_frames, etc...), exports a config object from your content script like so:

```ts
import type { PlasmoContentScript } from "plasmo"

export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["<all_urls>"],
  all_frames: true
}
```

Working with this configuration object is a breeze thanks to the exported `PlasmoContentScript` type ðŸ¥³.

## Adding a Background script

In the root directory, create a `background.ts` file, and start coding away ðŸ’ª. See [with-background](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-background).

## Adding Options UI

Plasmo automatically detects the `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui. See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)
