# Content Scripts

Content scripts run in the context of web pages.

> **NOTE:** Since Plasmo's default Typescript configuration treats all source files as modules, if you don't have any imports or exports in your code, you'll have to add an `export {}` line at the start of your file. (You will see this warning when creating your first content script!)

### Use cases:

- Scraping data from the current web page
- Selecting, finding, and styling elements from the current web page
- [Injecting UI elements into the current web page](/workflows/content-scripts-ui)

## Adding a single content script

Create a `content.ts` file that exports an empty object and hack away! See [with-content-script](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script) for an example.

## Adding multiple content scripts

Create a `contents` directory for multiple content scripts, and add your content scripts there. See [with-many-content-scripts](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-many-content-scripts) for an example.

## Customizing content script config

To provide a custom content script configuration, such as matching a custom domain per script, setting the `all_frames` key, etc., export a config object from your content script:

```ts
import type { PlasmoContentScript } from "plasmo"

export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["<all_urls>"],
  all_frames: true
}
```

Working with this configuration object is a breeze thanks to the exported `PlasmoContentScript` type ðŸ¥³.

## Injecting into the main world

You must inject into the main world if you'd like to access the `window` object from your content script.

It's not currently possible to declaratively inject content scripts into the main world via the `content_scripts` manifest field.

Instead, Chrome offers a `chrome.scripting.executeScript` API that lets you inject content scripts into the main world.

```ts
 chrome.scripting.executeScript(
    {
      target: {
        tabId // the tab you want to inject into
      },
      world: "MAIN", // MAIN to access the window object
      func: windowChanger // function to inject
    },
    () => {
      console.log("Background script got callback after injection")
    }
  )
}
```

For the `func` key, you can pass in a Typescript function from your project, which will automatically convert to a JavaScript function when your extension bundles.

See [with-main-world-content-script-injection](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-main-world-content-script-injection) for an example.

### Importing Web Accessible Resources

Use the `url:` scheme to load assets to be used from web-accessible resources.

Web-accessible resources are helpful if you'd like to reference static content from your content script, and the `data-base64` or `data-text` schemes aren't a good solution to your problem.

#### Usage

In your content script,

```ts
import myJavascriptFile from "url:./path/to/my/file/something.js"
```

`something.js` will be bundled and added to the `web_accessible_resources` manifest.json key automatically â€” no need to do it manually.

What is `myJavascriptFile`?

```sh
> console.log(myJavascriptFile)

chrome-extension://<your chrome ext id>/something.eb20bc99.js?1656000646313

```

The imported variable is a string that points to the path of the resource.

So access that JavaScript file however you'd like!
