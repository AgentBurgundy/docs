# Content Scripts

Content scripts run in the context of web pages. Some of the most common use cases are:

- Scraping data from the current web page
- Selecting, finding, and styling elements from the current web page
- [Injecting UI elements into the current web page](#injecting-ui-elements)

## Adding a single content script

Create a `content.ts` file that exports an empty object (or import a library), and hack away! See [with-content-script](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script) for an example.

## Adding multiple content scripts

Create a `contents` directory for multiple content scripts and add your content scripts there. See [with-many-content-scripts](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-many-content-scripts) for an example.

## Customizing content script config

To provide a custom content script configuration (such as matching a custom domain per script, all_frames, etc.), export a config object from your content script like so:

```ts
import type { PlasmoContentScript } from "plasmo"

export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["<all_urls>"],
  all_frames: true
}
```

Working with this configuration object is a breeze thanks to the exported `PlasmoContentScript` type ðŸ¥³.

## Injecting into the main world

You must inject into the main world if you'd like to access the `window` object from your content script.

Currently, it's not possible to declaratively inject content scripts into the main world via the `content_scripts` manifest field.

Instead, Chrome offers a `chrome.scripting.executeScript` API that allows you to inject content scripts into the main world.

```ts
 chrome.scripting.executeScript(
    {
      target: {
        tabId // the tab you want to inject into
      },
      world: "MAIN", // MAIN to access the window object
      func: windowChanger // function to inject
    },
    () => {
      console.log("Background script got callback after injection")
    }
  )
}
```

For the `func` key, you can pass in a Typescript function from your project, which will automatically convert to a JavaScript function when your extension bundles.

See [with-main-world-content-script-injection](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-main-world-content-script-injection) for an example.

## Injecting UI elements

Plasmo has first-class support for mounting a React component into the current webpage via a content script.

1. Rename an existing content script or create a new one with the `tsx` extension
2. Export default a React component
3. Profit ðŸŽ‰

See [with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-scripts-ui)

### How does Plasmo mount the React component?

Plasmo creates a [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to mount the component. This isolation technique prevents the web page's style from affecting your component's styling.

## getMountPoint

There are cases where you might want to mount/anchor your react component on top of a specific element on the current webpage. To do so, export a function called `getMountPoint` that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```ts
export const getMountPoint = async () => document.querySelector("#element")
```

This function can be asynchronous, which allows you to wait until the element exists. It is also very agnostic. For example, you can send the current webpage to a remote API via fetch to calculate the element selector, then query and return that element. The possibilities are endless!

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-mount.tsx) for an example.

### How does getMountPoint anchor my component?

It first listens to the scroll event of the current window. On each scroll event, it uses the `getBoundingClientRect` method to calculate the absolute position of the target element. Then, it applies the position to the container used to mount your component.

## getStyle

To inject stylesheets into your content script UI's Shadow DOM (or anywhere in the current webpage), you may export a `getStyle` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement.style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) element:

```ts
import cssText from "data-text:~/contents/plasmo-overlay.css"

export const getStyle = () => {
  const style = document.createElement("style")
  style.textContent = cssText
  return style
}
```

Plasmo will append the style element into the Shadow DOM before the container of the exported component.

See [the plasmo-overlay.tsx file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-overlay.tsx) for an example.

### Note about `data-text` schemes

In the example above, we use the `data-text` scheme to load our stylesheet as plain text into the cssText variable, which we then assign to our style element's textContent. Be cautious with this scheme's import path if you use the `src` directory, as noted [here](/workflows/assets#data-base64-and-data-text-schemes).

## getRootContainer

To replace the provided Shadow DOM, you can export a `getRootContainer` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement).

Use cases:

- Extension needs to [absorb the styling of the host webpage](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/10#issuecomment-1149499252)
- Extension needs to mount the component directly into the webpage instead of having an overlay shadow DOM

```ts
export const getRootContainer = () => {
  return document.querySelector("#feature")
}
```

> **NOTE:** If you export a `getRootContainer` function, Plasmo ignores the `getStyle` function since only the provided Shadow DOM container uses it. The behavior of `getMountPoint` might also be affected (as the component's position will be relative to your provided container).

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-root-container.tsx) for an example.
