# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I update Plasmo to the latest version?

You will need to purge the lock file and run the install subcommand of your chosen package manager to get the latest version of Plasmo. You can manually pin Plasmo's version by upgrading its version number in `package.json` and running the install subcommand accordingly.

## Tilde Import Resolution

The tilde (`~`) **always** resolves to the root project directory where the `package.json` resides if used with a scheme such as `data-base64`, `data-text`, or `url`. Thus, `data-base64:~assets/image.png` resolves to `/assets/image.png` and `url:~src/code.js` resolves to `/src/code.js.`

If the tilde is by itself without a scheme and is being used to import a source code module (`ts` or `tsx` files), it has two behaviors depending on whether you are using the default setup or the [the `src` directory setup](/customization#using-src-directory-for-source-code):

- With the default setup, `~` points to the project root.
- With the `src` directory setup, `~` points to the `src` directory. Thus `~core/code-module.tsx`, resolves to `/src/core/code-module.tsx`.
