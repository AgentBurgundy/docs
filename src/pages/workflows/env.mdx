# Using Environment Variables

The Plasmo framework utilizes a similar .env file cascading/overriding strategy as Next.js, using the [`dotenv` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). To add public environment variables accessible to the extension, create a `.env` file like so:

```ini
PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME=ncc-1701
PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY=42

PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
```

Only environment variables prefixed with `PLASMO_PUBLIC_` will be exposed in the built version of your extension. You can then use them in any of your extension source files:

```tsx
// For TSX (popups, options):
const FrontHull = () => <h1>{process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME}</h1>

// For TS (content scripts or background-scripts):
const shield = new Shield(process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY)

// Will throw error/be undefined
console.log(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY)
```

To override a variable in the production build with `plasmo build`, you may supply a `.env.production` file. Since Plasmo "cascades" these env files, you only need to specify the variable you want to replace.

You might also enjoy Typescript IntelliSense with your environment variables ðŸ¤“. To do so, create an `index.d.ts` file with the declaration below:

```ts
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME?: string
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY?: number
  }
}
```

See [with-env-files](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-env-files) for more details about using .env variables.

## Non-cascading environment variables

Sometimes, you might want certain environment variables strictly for development, not cascading down to their production build. To enable this behavior, you can use environment-specific files:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.production`

If there is a `CRX_PUBLIC_KEY` variable in `.env.development` but not in `.env.production` or `.env`, then it will only be available in `plasmo dev` and not `plasmo build`.

## Local namespaced environment variables

Since we are using the same parsing algorithm as Next.js, Plasmo also supports the following environment files:

- `.env.local`
- `.env.production.local`
- `.env.development.local`

Note that these files are a higher priority than the non-local ones. Thus, `.env.local` has higher priority than `.env.production` and `.env.development`. Within the same namespace, however, the cascading order is as expected.

## Using env in remote-code import statements

You can use public environment variables if you are [importing remote code](/workflows/remote-code):

```tsx
import "https://www.plasmo.com/js?id=$PLASMO_PUBLIC_ITERO"
```

## Using env in manifest overrides

Plasmo enables you to [override the final generated extension manifest via the `manifest` property of the package.json file](/customization#overriding-the-manifest). Even more powerful, Plasmo also parses any environment variables used in the manifest overrides:

```json
"manifest": {
  "key": "$CRX_PUBLIC_KEY"
}
```

You can use both public (prefixed with `PLASMO_PUBLIC`) and private environment variables ðŸ˜Ž

> **NOTE:** Plasmo will delete the key if it can't find the environment variable.
