# Assets

Plasmo processes some files within the `assets` directory. Use this feature to store assets you want to load inline into your source code instead of copying them into the built bundle.

## Extension icon with `assets/icon512.png`

Plasmo uses the `assets/icon512.png` file for the extension icon. It automatically generates a smaller resolution version of the icon for the final build bundle. All you need to work on is the 512x512 version!

## Importing image assets inline

The easiest way to load images inside your extension is to use the `data-base64` scheme. This will inline the image as base64 encoded data in the built bundle of your extension:

```tsx
import someCoolImage from "data-base64:~assets/some-cool-image.png"

...

<img src={someCoolImage} alt="Some pretty cool image" />
```

> NOTE: Please see this [note about `~` import resolution](/workflows/faq#tilde-import-resolution)

## Importing Web Accessible Resources

Plasmo automatically copy any web accessible resources declared in [the manifest override](/customization#overriding-the-manifest). For example, by specifying the config below in `package.json`:

```json
  "manifest": {
    "web_accessible_resources": [
      {
        "resources": [
          "~raw.js",
          "assets/pic*.png",
          "resources/test.json"
        ],
        "matches": [
          "https://www.plasmo.com/*"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "host_permissions": [
      "https://*/*"
    ]
  }
```

The files below will be copied into the extension bundle and be available to [`chrome.getURL()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/runtime/#method-getURL):

- `raw.js` in the root of the project (where package.json is)
- Any file matching the glob `assets/pic*.png` from the project root
- `resources/test.json` from the project root

You can also include files installed from `node_module` as well:

```json
  "resources": [
    "@inboxsdk/core/pageWorld.js",
    "@inboxsdk/core/background.js"
  ],
```
