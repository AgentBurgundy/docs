# Assets

Plasmo processes some files within the `assets` directory. We recommend using this feature to store any assets you might want to load inline into your source code (instead of copying them into the built bundle).

## icon512.png

The framework processes the `assets/icon512.png` file to generate smaller versions of the icon in the final build bundle.

## Import image assets inline

The easiest way to load images inside your extension is to use the `data-url` protocol. This will inline the image as base64 encoded data in the built bundle of your extension:

```tsx
import someCoolImage from "data-url:~assets/some-cool-image.png"

...

<img src={someCoolImage} alt="Some pretty cool image" />
```
