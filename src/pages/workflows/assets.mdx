# Assets

Plasmo processes some files within the `assets` directory. We recommend using this feature to store any assets you might want to load inline into your source code (instead of copying them into the built bundle).

## Extension icon with `assets/icon512.png`

The framework uses the `assets/icon512.png` file for the extension icon. It automatically generates smaller resolution version of the icon for the final build bundle. Thus all you need to work on is the 512x512 version!

## Importing image assets inline

The easiest way to load images inside your extension is to use the `data-base64` scheme. This will inline the image as base64 encoded data in the built bundle of your extension:

```tsx
import someCoolImage from "data-base64:~assets/some-cool-image.png"

...

<img src={someCoolImage} alt="Some pretty cool image" />
```

> NOTE: Please see this [note about `~` import resolution](/workflows/faq#tilde-import-resolution)
