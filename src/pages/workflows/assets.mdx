# Assets

Plasmo processes some files within the `assets` directory. We recommend using this feature to store any assets you might want to load inline into your source code (instead of copying them into the built bundle).

## Extension icon with `assets/icon512.png`

The framework uses the `assets/icon512.png` file for the extension icon. It automatically generates smaller resolution version of the icon for the final build bundle. Thus all you need to work on is the 512x512 version!

## Importing image assets inline

The easiest way to load images inside your extension is to use the `data-base64` scheme. This will inline the image as base64 encoded data in the built bundle of your extension:

```tsx
import someCoolImage from "data-base64:~assets/some-cool-image.png"

...

<img src={someCoolImage} alt="Some pretty cool image" />
```

## `data-base64` and `data-text` schemes

`data-base64` and `data-text` schemes' tilde (`~`) **always** resolves to the root directory. This is especially important if you are using [the `src` directory setup](/customization#using-src-directory-for-source-code). With the `src` setup, the `~` has two meanings:

- If it is by itself, e.g `~core/code-module`, Plasmo resolves it to `/src/core/core-module.ts` (or tsx).
- If using with the two schemes mentioned above, the `~` is resolves to project root. Thus, `data-base64:~assets/image.png` resolves to `/assets/image.png`.
