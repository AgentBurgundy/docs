# Development Cycle

> ðŸ“¢ **NOTE:** If you would like to use the `src` directory for your source code (`tsx` and `ts`), please make sure to follow this [guide](/customization#using-src-directory-for-source-code).

## Create a new extension

To run the interactive initialization wizard, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

To skip the naming prompt, supply a name as a positional argument:

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init "My Awesome Extension"
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init "My Awesome Extension"
```

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch `pnpm` with your favorite package manager).

## Run the development server

Once you've set up your project, you can start developing your extension by navigating to your project directory and running:

```sh
pnpm dev
# OR
npm run dev
# OR
plasmo dev
```

This will create a dev bundle for your extension and a hot-reloading development server, automatically updating your extension bundle on file changes and reloading your browser on source code changes.

## Loading the extension

We plan to automate this in the future, but for the time being, these are the steps you need to take to load your extension in Chrome.

Head over to `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mode.

Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to your extension's `build/chrome-mv3-dev` (or `build/chrome-mv3-prod`) directory.

To see your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and click on your extension.

**Pro tip:** you can pin your extension to the Chrome toolbar for easy access by clicking the pin button.

## Create a production bundle

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build
# OR
npm run build
# OR
plasmo build
```

You can optionally supply a `--zip` flag to the build command to create a zip bundle ready to be uploaded to the web stores:

```sh
pnpm build -- --zip
# OR
npm run build -- --zip
# OR
plasmo build --zip
```

> **NOTE:** Since Plasmo's default Typescript configuration treats all source files as modules, if you don't have any imports or exports in your code, you'll have to add an `export {}` line at the start of your file. (You will see this warning when creating your first content script!)

## Adding a Popup Page

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file that exports a default React component. With that, your popup is ready to be used ðŸš€!

See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-popup)

## Adding the Options UI

Create either an `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui ðŸ‘Œ

See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)

## Adding a New Tab Page

Create a `newtab.tsx` file or a `newtab/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest to render your new tab page ðŸ¤˜!

See [with-newtab](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-newtab)

## Adding a Background Service Worker

Create a `background.ts` file in the root directory, and start hacking ðŸ’ª
