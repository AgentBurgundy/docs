# Development Cycle

## Create a new extension

To run the interactive initialization wizard, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

To skip the naming prompt, supply a name as a positional argument:

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init "My Awesome Extension"
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init "My Awesome Extension"
```

## Run the development server

Once you've set up your project, you can start developing your extension by navigating to your project directory and running:

```sh
pnpm dev
# OR
npm run dev
# OR
plasmo dev
```

This will create a dev bundle for your extension and a hot-reloading development server, automatically updating your extension bundle on file changes and reloading your browser on source code changes.

## Create a production bundle

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build
# OR
npm run build
# OR
plasmo build
```

You can optionally supply a `--zip` flag to the build command to create a zip bundle ready to be uploaded to the web stores:

```sh
pnpm build -- --zip
# OR
npm run build -- --zip
# OR
plasmo build --zip
```

> **NOTE:** Since Plasmo's default Typescript configuration treats all source files as modules, if you don't have any imports or exports in your code, you'll have to add an `export {}` line at the start of your file. (You will see this warning when creating your first content script!)

## Adding a Popup Page

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file that exports a default React component. With that, your popup is ready to be used ðŸš€!

See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-popup)

## Adding the Options UI

Create either an `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui ðŸ‘Œ

See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)

## Adding a New Tab Page

Create a `newtab.tsx` file or a `newtab/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest to render your new tab page ðŸ¤˜!

See [with-newtab](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-newtab)

## Adding a Background script

Create a `background.ts` file in the root directory, and start hacking ðŸ’ª
