# Plasmo Framework

The [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) Framework is a low-config declarative browser extension development SDK. Build your product and stop worrying about manifest.json files and the odd peculiarities of building browser extensions.

> It's like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for browser extensions!

Features include:

- First-class React + Typescript Support
- Declarative development
- Live-reloading
- `manifest.json` auto-generation
- MV3-by-default
- .env file support

And a large backlog of features that haven't been built yet!

## Requirements

Plasmo is an opinionated framework. As such, we support the following technologies out-of-the-box:

- View Library
  - React
- Language
  - Typescript
- Testing Library
  - Jest
- Browser Extension Version
  - Manifest Version 3

We have many examples showcasing how one can use Plasmo with [Firebase Authentication](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-firebase-auth), [Redux](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-redux), [Supabase authentication](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-supabase), [Tailwind](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-tailwindcss), and a bunch more you can see if you visit our [examples repository](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples).

## Quick Start

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

This command will set up the scaffolding for a browser extension project with a popup, utilizing the Plasmo Framework. The structure is straightforward:

- `popup.tsx`: This file exports default a React component, which gets rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_
- `assets`: Plasmo automatically generates the smaller icons and applies them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file.
- `package.json`: Your usual Node.js project descriptor, with an optional "manifest" property to override any desired manifest values.
- `.prettierrc.cjs`: For code styling consistency
- `.gitignore`: Your friendly neighborhood gitignore file.
- `readme.md`: Basic documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch `pnpm` with your favorite package manager).

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. Plasmo generates the manifest based on the source files you create and configurations you export from your source files - similar to how [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) abstracts page routing and SSG with the file system and page components.

We will abstract even further with auto-permissions and a needs-based permission scheme, which will remove the need to specify permissions manually! _(Coming soon)_

## Next Steps

Check out the [Workflows section](./workflows) for a deep dive on how to work with Plasmo. A modular example accompanies each workflow, showcasing the framework's simplicity. View examples on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples).

Check out the [customization section](./customization) for documentation on making Plasmo adapt to your needs.
