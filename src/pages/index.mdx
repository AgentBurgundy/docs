# Plasmo Framework

The Plasmo Framework is a declarative browser extension development SDK. Our goal is to abstract away most of the configuration of building browser extensions, so you can focus on the functionality of your product and ship faster!

## Quick Start

```
pnpm dlx plasmo init
```

![](/screenshots/file_structure.png)

This command will set up a browser extension project with a popup, utilizing the Plasmo Framework. As you can see in the screenshot, the structure of this project is very simple:

- `popup.tsx`: This file exports default a react component, which get rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_
- `assets`: Plasmo automatically generate the smaller icons and apply them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file.
- `package.json`: Your usual nodejs project descriptor, with an optional "manifest" property to overide any manifest values you desired.
- `.prettierrc.cjs`: For code styling consistency
- `.gitignore`: Your friendly neighborhood gitignore file.
- `readme.md`: Basic documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch pnpm with your appropriate package manager).

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. We call this feature "auto-pilot manifest.json". The bundle is based on the file system and configuration you exported from your source files - similar to how [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) abstracted page routing and SSG with the file system and the page components. We abstract even further with auto-permission and need-based permission scheme, which removes the need to manually specify permission altogether! _(Coming soon)_
