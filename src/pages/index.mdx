The [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) Framework is a battery-packed browser extension development SDK made by hackers for hackers. Build your product and stop worrying about config files and the odd peculiarities of building browser extensions.

> It's like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for browser extensions!

![CLI Demo](https://www.plasmo.com/assets/plasmo-cli-demo.gif)

## Features

- First-class [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Support
- [Declarative development with `manifest.json` auto-generation (MV3)](/#where-is-the-manifestjson-file)
- Live-reloading
- [`.env*` files](/workflows/env)
- [Remote code bundling](/workflows/remote-code) (e.g for gtag4)
- Automated deployment (via [BPP](/workflows/submit))
- And many, many more! ðŸš€

## System Requirements

- Node.js 16.x or later
- MacOS, Windows, or Linux
- (Strongly Recommended) [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Quick Start

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

![Plasmo project files](/screenshots/file_structure.png)

This command will set up the simplest Plasmo browser extension project for you. The structure is straightforward:

| File name         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `popup.tsx`       | This file exports default a React component, which gets rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_         |
| `assets`          | Plasmo automatically generates the smaller icons and applies them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file                                  |
| `package.json`    | Your usual Node.js project descriptor, with [an optional "manifest" property to customize Plasmo to your need](/customization#overriding-the-manifest) |
| `.prettierrc.cjs` | For code styling consistency                                                                                                                           |
| `.gitignore`      | Your friendly neighborhood git ignore file                                                                                                             |
| `readme.md`       | Basic documentation                                                                                                                                    |
| `tsconfig.json`   | TypeScript configuration                                                                                                                               |

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch `pnpm` with your favorite package manager).

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. Plasmo generates the manifest based on the source files you create and configurations you export from your code - similar to how [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) abstracts page routing and SSG with the file system and page components.

We will abstract even further with auto-permissions and a needs-based permission scheme, which will remove the need to specify permissions manually! _(Coming soon)_

## Next Steps

Check out the [Workflows section](./workflows) for a deep dive on how to work with Plasmo. A modular example accompanies each workflow, showcasing the framework's simplicity. View examples on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples).

Check out the [Customization section](./customization) for documentation on making Plasmo adapt to your needs.

To see how to integrate Plasmo with other tools (such as TailwindCSS or Firebase), checkout out the list of examples in the [Advanced section](./advanced).
