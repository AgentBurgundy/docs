# Plasmo Framework

The Plasmo Framework is the React Framework for Browser Extensions development. We abstract away most of the configuration of building browser extensions so that you can focus on the functionality of your product and ship faster!

> It's like [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) but for browser extension ðŸ˜‰

### System Requirements

- Node.js 16.x or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
- (Strongly Recommended) (pnpm)[https://pnpm.io/]

### Pre-requiste Knowledge

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)

## Quick Start

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

This command will set up a browser extension project with a basic popup page, utilizing the Plasmo Framework. As you can see in the screenshot, the structure of this project is straightforward:

- `popup.tsx`: This file exports default a React component, which gets rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_
- `assets`: Plasmo automatically generates the smaller icons and applies them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file.
- `package.json`: Your usual Node.js project descriptor, with an optional "manifest" property to override any desired manifest values.
- `.prettierrc.cjs`: For code styling consistency
- `.gitignore`: Your friendly neighborhood gitignore file.
- `readme.md`: Basic documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch pnpm with your appropriate package manager).

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. We call this feature "auto-pilot manifest.json". Plasmo bundles it based on the file system, and configuration you export from your source files - similar to how [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) abstracts page routing and SSG with the file system and page components. We will abstract even further with auto-permission and a needs-based permission scheme, which removes the need to specify permissions manually! _(Coming soon)_

Checkout the [Workflows section](./workflows) for a deep-dive on how to work with Plasmo. Each workflow is accompanied with a basic, modular example showcasing the simplicity of the framework. Those examples are published on GitHub: [Check them out here.](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples).

Checkout the [Customization section](./customization) for documentation on how to make Plasmo adapts to your needs.
