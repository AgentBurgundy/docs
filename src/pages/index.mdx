# Plasmo Framework

The Plasmo Framework is a declarative browser extension development SDK. We abstract away most of the configuration of building browser extensions so that you can focus on the functionality of your product and ship faster!

## Quick Start

```
pnpm dlx plasmo init
```

![](/screenshots/file_structure.png)

This command will set up a browser extension project with a popup, utilizing the Plasmo Framework. As you can see in the screenshot, the structure of this project is straightforward:

- `popup.tsx`: This file exports default a React component, which gets rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_
- `assets`: Plasmo automatically generates the smaller icons and applies them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file.
- `package.json`: Your usual Node.js project descriptor, with an optional "manifest" property to override any desired manifest values.
- `.prettierrc.cjs`: For code styling consistency
- `.gitignore`: Your friendly neighborhood gitignore file.
- `readme.md`: Basic documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch pnpm with your appropriate package manager).

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. We call this feature "auto-pilot manifest.json". Plasmo bundles it based on the file system, and configuration you export from your source files - similar to how [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) abstracts page routing and SSG with the file system and page components. We will abstract even further with auto-permission and a needs-based permission scheme, which removes the need to specify permissions manually! _(Coming soon)_

## Examples
We have a repository full of different ways you can use Plasmo. [Check it out here.](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples)
