description: Basic documentation and quick start for the Plasmo browser extension framework.
---

## Introduction

The Plasmo Framework is a declarative browser extension development SDK. Our goal is to abstract away most of the configuration of building browser extensions, so you can focus on the functionality of your product and ship faster!

## Quick Start

```
pnpm dlx plasmo init
```

![](/screenshots/file_structure.png)

This command will set up a browser extension project with a popup, utilizing the Plasmo Framework. As you can see in the screenshot, the structure of this project is very simple:

- `popup.tsx`: This file exports default a react component, which get rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_
- `assets`: Plasmo automatically generate the smaller icons and apply them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file.
- `package.json`: Your usual nodejs project descriptor, with an optional "manifest" property to overide any manifest values you desired.
- `.prettierrc.cjs`: For code styling consistency
- `.gitignore`: Your friendly neighborhood gitignore file.
- `readme.md`: Basic documentation
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration

> **NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch pnpm with your appropriate package manager).

### Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you (we call this `auto-pilot manifest.json`) based on the file system and configuration you exported from your source files - similar to how [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) abstracted page routing and SSG with the file system and the page components. We abstract even further with auto-permission and need-based permission scheme, which removes the need to manually specify permission altogether! _(Coming soon)_

## Development cycle

Once your project is setup, you can start developing your extension by first `cd` inside your project, then:

```sh
pnpm dev # OR plasmo dev
```

This will create a dev bundle for your extension, as well as a hot-reloading development server, which will automatically update your extension bundle on file changes. It will also reload your browser on content-script changes. _(Coming soon)_

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build  # OR plasmo dev
```

> **NOTE:** Since plasmo's default typescript configuration treats all source file as a module, if your source is not importing anything, please add a `export {}` at the start of your source. (You will see this warning when you created your first content script!)

### Adding a Popup Page

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file, then start coding away! See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script).

### Adding Content Scripts

Create a `content.ts` file, and start coding away! See [with-content-script](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script).

For multiple content scripts, create a `contents` directory, and add your content scripts there. See [with-many-content-scripts](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-many-content-scripts).

To provide custom content script configuration (such as matching custom domain per script, all_frames, etc...), exports a config object from your content script like so:

```ts
import type { PlasmoContentScript } from "plasmo"

export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["<all_urls>"],
  all_frames: true
}
```

Working with this configuration object is a breeze thanks to the exported `PlasmoContentScript` type ðŸ¥³.

### Background

In the root directory, create a `background.ts` file, and start coding away ðŸ’ª. See [with-background](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-background).

### Options

Plasmo automatically detects the `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui. See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)

## Custom Configuration

### Overriding the Manifest

The Plasmo framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field for you to overide the default extension manifest. Use this to specify permissions and any additional hosts you might need, as well as extra `option_uis` configs.

We also use a `displayName` field in the `package.json` to specify the name of the web extension.
